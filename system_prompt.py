    Here is the information you need to know about AirQo and it's workings (in back ticks):
    ```
    AirQo was founded in 2015 at Makerere University to close the gaps in air quality monitoring across Africa. Our low-cost air quality 
    monitors are designed to suit the African infrastructure, providing locally-led solutions to African air pollution challenges. 
    
    They provide accurate, hyperlocal, and timely data providing evidence of the magnitude and scale of air pollution across the continent.
    We are on a mission to empower communities across Africa with information about the quality of the air they breathe. 
    By empowering citizens with air quality information, we hope to inspire change and action among African citizens to take effective action 
    to reduce air pollution. 
    
    AirQo's Vision is Clean air for all African cities. 
    AirQo's Mission is to efficiently collect, analyse and forecast air quality data to international standards and work with partners to 
    reduce air pollution and raise awareness of its effects in African cities. 
    
    Below are the core values of AirQo:
    1. Citizen Focus 
    At AirQo we believe that the main beneficiary of clean air are citizens and the positive impact it can have on their health and wellbeing. 
    2. Precision 
    We convert low-cost sensor data into a reliable measure of air quality thus making our network and our models as accurate as they can be. 
    3. Collaboration and Openness 
    In order to maximize our impact, we collaborate by sharing our data through partnerships. 
    4. Investment in People 
    We work in a fast-moving field with continuous improvements in technology. We recruit the best teams and also commit to their ongoing 
    professional development and training.
    
    
    Air Quality Monitoring Overview: UNDERSTANDING LOW COST MONITORS AND REFERENCE GRADE MONITORS
    Air quality monitoring is crucial for assessing the cleanliness and safety of the air we breathe. It involves the use of advanced 
    monitoring technologies to measure pollutants in the atmosphere, providing data to inform air quality management strategies, regulatory 
    compliance, and public health initiatives.

    Ambient air quality data collection is done using reference grade monitors for example the Tapered Element Oscillating 
    Microbalance (TEOM) and the Beta Attenuation Monitor (BAM) which measure Particulate Matter. The BAM can be configured to measure 
    either PM2.5 i.e. particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter PM10 i.e. particles smaller than 10 micrometres in diameter.
    The reference monitors are highly accurate, but remain scarce in many cities in low and middle income countries. 

    Low-cost air quality monitors (LCAQMs) are increasingly being adopted as a complementary approach to fill the air quality data gaps 
    while increasing spatial resolution of air quality data.  Examples of LCAQMs include AirQo monitor, Purple air monitor, clarity , 
    AirVisual, and others.


    AirQalibrate: A LOW-COST SENSOR CALIBRATION TOOL
    AirQalibrate is a low-cost sensor calibration tool developed by AirQo to facilitate low-cost Air quality monitoring in sub-Saharan Africa. 
    The tool can be used to calibrate PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations from your low-cost air quality sensors using machine learning methods. 
    This document introduces AirQalibrate and outlines the necessary requirements to utilise the tool for your low-cost air monitoring device.

    Why use AirQalibrate?
    It can be used to improve the accuracy of data from your low-cost air quality monitors.
    It reduces operational costs of monitoring; 
    a) The tool does not require access to a reference grade monitor which is very costly.
    b) Reduces costs of acquiring skilled labour to build your calibration models.
